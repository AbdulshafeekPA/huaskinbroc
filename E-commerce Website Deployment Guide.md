## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)

The `build/` folder contains the production-ready static files. You can deploy these to any static hosting service:

**Popular Static Hosting Services:**
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `build` folder to netlify.com/drop
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo or upload the build folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Upload build contents to your repository
- **AWS S3**: Upload to S3 bucket with static website hosting
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase CLI to deploy

### Option 2: Traditional Web Server

Upload the contents of the `build/` folder to your web server's public directory (e.g., `public_html`, `www`, or `htdocs`).

### Option 3: Node.js Server

Install a static file server:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build -l 3000
```

## Local Development

To run the website locally for development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Customization

### Adding Products

Edit `src/data/products.js` to add, remove, or modify products. Each product should have:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Product name
- `price`: Product price
- `image`: Product image URL
- `category`: Product category
- `description`: Product description
- `rating`: Star rating (1-5)
- `reviews`: Number of reviews
- `inStock`: Availability status

### Styling

All styles are in individual CSS files next to their components. The main global styles are in `src/App.css`.

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new component in `src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `src/App.js`
3. Add navigation links as needed

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance

The production build is optimized with:
- Code splitting
- Minification
- Gzip compression
- Image optimization
- CSS optimization

## Security Notes

This is a frontend-only demo website. For production use, you would need to:
- Implement real payment processing
- Add user authentication
- Connect to a backend API
- Add form validation and security measures
- Implement proper error handling

## Support

The website is fully functional as a demo e-commerce site. All features work locally and will work when deployed to any static hosting service.
